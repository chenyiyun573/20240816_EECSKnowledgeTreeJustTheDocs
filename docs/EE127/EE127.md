# Welcome to EECS 127/227A!

Lecture recordings from this semester are available here. Lecture recordings from a previous semester (Fall 2022) are available here. They cover a lot of the current course material, but neither set of material is a strict superset of the other.

Previous semesters’ staff have written a course reader (i.e., set of course notes), accessible [here](http://public2.yuantsy.com/Test/EE127/eecs127_reader.pdf). This semester’s staff will periodically update and improve the reader.

Readings posted next to each lecture use the abbreviations:

- CEG, which stands for the textbook Optimization Models by Calafiore and El Ghaoui;
- BV, which stands for the textbook [Convex Optimization]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/example/)
 by Boyd and Vandenberghe.
