# EE 1o5. Microelectronic Devices and Circuits

{: .no_toc }



<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

## Catalog Description:
This course covers the fundamental circuit and device concepts needed to understand analog integrated circuits. After an overview of the basic properties ofcemiconductors,the p-njunction and MOs capacitors are described and the MOsfETis modeled as a large signal device. wo port smalsignal amplfiers and their realzation using singestage and mutitage CMOs building blocks are dicused.sinusoidal steadystate sienals areintroduced and the technigues of phasor anawsis are developed,incudingimpedance andthmagnitude and phase response of linear circuits.Thefreguencyresponses of single and multi-stage amplifiers are analyzed. ifferential amplifiers are introduced
